This C++ program is a word search solver that finds specific words within a 2D character grid using a combination of Trie data structure and recursive backtracking. The Trie is used to store all the input words efficiently, enabling fast prefix checking during the search process. Each node in the Trie represents a character and tracks whether it marks the end of a complete word. This structure allows the algorithm to abandon non-matching paths early, improving performance significantly, especially for larger grids or longer word lists.

The search process begins by scanning each cell in the grid and recursively exploring all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) from that cell. The program avoids revisiting cells during the construction of a single word path by temporarily marking them as visited. If the current path of characters matches a word in the Trie, that word is added to the result set, and its corresponding coordinates in the grid are recorded. The algorithm then continues searching for other possible word occurrences without duplicating results.

User interaction is built into the program, prompting for the grid size, the grid content, and the list of words to search. The results are displayed in a user-friendly format, showing the found words and the exact coordinates of each character in the grid. The code uses standard C++ libraries like vector, unordered_map, and map to manage data efficiently. Overall, this project showcases a practical implementation of Trie and backtracking in solving a classic grid-based search problem.
